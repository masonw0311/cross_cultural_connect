Scheduling post deletion after 14 days

Using cron to schedule, delete_old_posts to execute

1. find python path:
$ which python

2. find path to project home dir (where manage.py is located)
$ pwd

3. Enter crontab editor
$ crontab -e

4. Type the following command: (paths found in steps 2 and 3 above)
- 0 0 * * * /path/to/python /path/to/manage.py delete_old_posts

5. verify cron
$ crontab -l

If done correctly, the step 5 command will echo the cron job entered in step 4

Components of cron job:
<minute> <hour> <day_of_month> <month> <day_of_week> <path to python> <path to manage.py> <script to execute>

Time entries denote when the script will execute. * means "every"

So our command above executes delete_old_posts.py 
at 00:00 (midnight) every day of the month, every month, every day of the week
