Getting started

a. Pre-conditions
1. Ensure git is installed

2. Ensure conda is installed

3. ensure pip is installed ( should be included with anaconda or miniconda)

1. Git

a. Open a terminal (or use the terminal in VS Code) and navigate to a folder where you want to clone the project.

b. Run the following command to clone the repository:
        $ git clone https://github.com/wedberry/cross_cultural_connect/

c. Navigate into the cloned project directory:
        $ cd cross_cultural_connect




II. Conda


a. Ensure conda is installed 
        $ conda --version

b. Create conda env
        $ conda create -n cc_connect python=3.12

c. activate environment
        $ conda activate cc_connect

d. Install the required dependencies from requirements.txt:
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

e. Set up google authorization
        > download "service-accounts-key.json"
                (see group chat for this file. It is very bad to put our api secret key on a public github)
        $ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-accounts-key.json/"



III. Set up and verify Django project

a. apply migrations
        $ python manage.py migrate

b. Add yourself as admin
        $ python manage.py createsuperuser

c. Verify django setup
        $ python manage.py runserver

        navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to verify the project is working




IV. Git Workflow


a. To get latest version before you start working:
        $ git pull origin main


b. Stage, commit, push
        $ git add .
        $ git commit -m “Description of changes made”
        $ git push origin main




V. Considerations

a. Note any environement changes, update requirements.txt with 
        $ pip freeze > requirements.txt


        ( let team know if you do this so we can update environments)

b. If there is a google authorization error
