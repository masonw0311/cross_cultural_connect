> git clone https://github.com/wedberry/cross_cultural_connect/


4. Navigate into the cloned project directory:
> cd cross_cultural_connect




II. Conda


1. Ensure conda is installed 
> conda --version


2. Create conda env
> conda create -n cc_connect python=3.12


3. activate environment
> conda activate cc_connect


4. Install the required dependencies from requirements.txt:
> pip install -r requirements.txt


III. Set up and verify Django project
