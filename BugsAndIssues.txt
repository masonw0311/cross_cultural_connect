CSRF Token error

Description:
Reloading page after login results in a crash and csrf token issue. The problem is that Django rotates tokens after login, causing token  to be stale.

Fix:
Use redirect after login instead of render. Any params can be passed as query parameters. 

For the login page, user is being passed as query parameter. This is not an issue, but user can be referenced directly in template. 
Need @login_required decorator in view, then can reference user directly in the template. For example: {{ user.username }}

Future fix: Properly escape single quotes

Incorrect location for markers
Description:
Incorrect latitude and longitude made businesses not show up or show up on the wrong
side of the world. 
28.23542 N, 81.2349 W did not show up
28.23542, 81.2349 showed up in India

Fix:
Proper latitude and longitude syntax in database

For lat and long:
North is positive, south is negative
East is positive, west is negative

So 28.23542 N, 81.2349 W is 28.23542, -81.2349
