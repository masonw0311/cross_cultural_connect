CSRF Token error

Description:
Reloading page after login results in a crash and csrf token issue. The problem is that Django rotates tokens after login, causing token  to be stale.

Fix:
Use redirect after login instead of render. Any params can be passed as query parameters. 

For the login page, user is being passed as query parameter. This is not an issue, but user can be referenced directly in template. 
Need @login_required decorator in view, then can reference user directly in the template. For example: {{ user.username }}
