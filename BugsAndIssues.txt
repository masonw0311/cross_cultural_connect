CSRF Token error

Description:
Reloading page after login results in a crash and csrf token issue. The problem is that Django rotates tokens after login, causing token  to be stale.

Fix:
Use redirect after login instead of render. Any params can be passed as query parameters. 

For the login page, user is being passed as query parameter. This is not an issue, but user can be referenced directly in template. 
Need @login_required decorator in view, then can reference user directly in the template. For example: {{ user.username }}



Uncaught Syntax Error missing ')'

In javascript console, json objects were incorrectly read, resulting in an error
Caused by having a "'" single quote in Rokka's supermarket. The single quote messed it up
Simple fix: no single quotes
Future fix: Properly escape single quotes


Incorrect location for markers

For lat and long:

North is positive, south is negative
East is positive, west is negative

So 28.23542 N, 81.2349 W is 28.23542, -81.2349
